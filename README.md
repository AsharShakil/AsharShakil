### Hey! I'm (Ashar Shakil) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst from Pakistan. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° 

I currently live in Berlin, Germany. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I am an fresh graduate who pursued his Masters degree in data analytics and looking for full time position around the globe . ðŸŒŽ

I created [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [**Typer**](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and a bunch of other open source tools. ðŸš€

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to FastAPI, Typer, and my other open source projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an **external consultant**. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“

If my open source projects are useful for your **product/company** you can also sponsor my work on them. â˜•
